# My Portfolio
This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my skills, experience, and projects to potential clients and employers. The website is built using modern web technologies and is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.



## Features

The website includes the following features:

* Home page with an introduction and links to my resume and social media profiles.
* About page with information about my background, education, and work experience.
* Projects page with a selection of my recent projects, including descriptions and links to the GitHub repositories and live demos.
* Skills page with a list of my technical skills, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
* Contact page with a form for visitors to send me a message or inquire about my services.



## Installation

To view the website locally on your computer, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
<br/> `git clone https://github.com/goelraghav002/myportfolio.git`

* Navigate to the project directory using the command:
<br/> `cd myportfolio`

* Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
<br/> `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

* Note: The npm run dev command is set up in the package.json file to start the development server using the vite command. If you want to build the production-ready version of your app, you can use the npm run build command, which will create an optimized build in the dist directory.
